Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\t\tThe intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source\u0026reg;, Valve\u0027s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cli\u003ECharacters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \u0022muscles,\u0022 human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cli\u003EPhysics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cli\u003EGraphics: Source\u0027s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story\u0026reg; and Monster\u0027s, Inc.\u0026reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cli\u003EAI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/ul\u003E",

    "desc": "As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame \u0026amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDinosaurs, Creatures, \u0026amp; Breeding! -- over 100\u002B creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-\u0026amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator \u0026amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants \u0026amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing \u0026amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage \u0026amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing \u0026amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians \u0026amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \u0026quot;Engrams\u0026quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you\u0027ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \u0026quot;Explorer Notes\u0026quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted \u0026amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text \u0026amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct \u0026amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn the 100\u002B player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK\u0027s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique \u0027Procedurally Generated ARKs\u0027, for infinite replayability and endless surprises.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting \u0026amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) \u0026amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the Guns of Icarus experience. What was originally intended to be an expansion that would introduce AI opponents and player-vs-environment gameplay grew into a new standalone game - Guns of Icarus Alliance, the ultimate and definitive Guns of Icarus experience - which released in March 2017.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E",

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFirefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESkirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOccupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \u0026quot;tug of war\u0026quot;.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmbush --- A high value target (\u0026quot;HVT\u0026quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It\u0027s one team\u0027s goal to make this happen and it\u0027s the other team\u0027s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EStrike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInfiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\u0027s goal is to take the enemy\u0027s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\u0027s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\u0027s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFlashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\u0027s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EElimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.Cooperative Game Modes\u003Cbr\u003ECheckpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESurvival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOutpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EConquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",

Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESpace Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EVolumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid.

We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!Dive Into a Vast Underwater World\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica\u0027s oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.Scavenge, Craft, and Survive\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.Construct Underwater Habitats\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.Unravel the Mystery\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?Disrupt the Food Chain\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.Handle the Pressure\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.Fear the Night\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.Dive Below the Ocean Floor\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.Open Development\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca\u003EGet weekly or daily updates,\u003C/a\u003E see \u003Ca\u003Ewhat the development team is working on,\u003C/a\u003E view \u003Ca\u003Ereal time change logs,\u003C/a\u003E and give feedback \u003Ca\u003Efrom inside the game.\u003C/a\u003E Subnautica Early Access development is open, and the development team wants to hear from you.About the Development Team\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESubnautica is being created by Unknown Worlds, a small studio founded by \u003Ca\u003ECharlie Cleveland\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca\u003EMax McGuire\u003C/a\u003E that traces its roots back to the 2003 Half-Life mod Natural Selection.

It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you\u0027re a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you\u0027ll earn even more points! Or you could just give Steam Workshop a spin and create your own goats, levels, missions, and more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.DisclaimerGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.Key Features\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can be a goat\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGet points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you\u0027re the alpha goat\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESteam Workshop support - make your own goats, levels, missions, game modes, and more!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMILLIONS OF BUGS!

During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience.

It works by controlling the \u201Crandom\u201D events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the \u003Cstrong\u003EAI Storyteller\u003C/strong\u003E. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYour colonists are not professional settlers\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEach person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.\u003C/strong\u003E A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EColonists develop - and destroy - relationships.\u003C/strong\u003E Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they\u0027ll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.\u003C/strong\u003E You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETravel across the planet.\u003C/strong\u003E You\u0027re not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou can tame and train animals.\u003C/strong\u003E Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPeople in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.\u003C/strong\u003E They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they\u0027re too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters\u0027 capacities.\u003C/strong\u003E Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer\u0027s leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino\u0027s horn, and it\u0027s much less dangerous.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.\u003C/strong\u003E A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he\u0027ll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd there\u0027s much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an \u003Ca\u003Eactive mod community\u003C/a\u003E.

At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, up to 12 players set out to track their monstrous targets. Depending on which mode and team options you\u2019ve chosen, that 12 will include a combination of solo players and teams of two or three. Once they\u2019ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty\u2014and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don\u2019t watch your back, you\u2019ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of someone else walking away with your prize.

    "desc": "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform, first-person, modern shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience. It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights, offering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the thrilling \u201Cone shot, one kill\u201D precision that made the original a huge hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments.Key Features\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\tMotion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pad\u2019s trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\tRealistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics.  Wind speed, distance, gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\tRefined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal \u201Cone shot; one kill.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\tImproved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was completely re-tooled and designed from scratch.  Much of the improvements were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\tNew Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\tVarious Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play \u2013 either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\tBullet-Cam: everyone\u2019s favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint.

In Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an entire squad.

With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary.

Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man\u0027s land in search of the enemy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOr if you want to chat with us...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E",

Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeople\u2019s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nThere are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nThe success or failure of a town depends on the appropriate management of risks and resources.",

    "desc": "BeamNG.drive is a realistic, immersive driving game offering near-limitless possibilities. Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior.                                        \u003Cbr\u003EThe driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEnvironments and vehicles in BeamNG.drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG.drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be.Why is BeamNG.drive the game for you?\u003Cbr\u003EAs an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG.drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn some ways, BeamNG.drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don\u0027t let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG.drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn\u0027t force you to do anything that you don\u0027t think is fun or interesting.The future of the game and our physics engine\u003Cbr\u003EAs we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWe will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAlso, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics.

Just an ordinary young man with thousands, even hundreds of thousands of those like him in every ordinary city. But one day something completely unusual happens to him: he falls asleep in a bus in winter and wakes up... in the middle of a hot summer. In front of him is \u0026quot;Sovyonok\u0026quot; - a pioneer camp, behind him is his former life. To understand what happened to him, Semyon will have to get to know the local inhabitants (and maybe even find love), find his way in the complex labyrinth of human relationships and his own problems and solve the camp\u0027s mysteries. And answer the main question - how to come back? Should he come back?",

In the 31st century the battlefields are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units called BattleMechs. Join the ranks of elite operators tasked with piloting these war machines. Choose your path to becoming the most feared MechWarrior in the Inner Sphere, fighting for battlefield supremacy against other players.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEnter the Solaris Arena.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe newest addition to MechWarrior online\u2122, Solaris 7, features 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 Mech Combat across 7 Divisions. Choose your BattleMech wisely, each of the 7 Divisions has a limited roster of BattleMechs available based on the Mech\u2019s performance capabilities on the battlefield. Take a Patron Contract, pick up sponsors, and earn accolades as you climb to the top of the Divisions Leaderboards. Solaris 7 features 5 maps tailored for intense Mech Combat.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EQuick Play is where you\u0027ll find fast action, fielding a single \u0027Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn Faction Play you will field 4 \u2018Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction\u0027s territory across the Inner Sphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPiloting a \u0027Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENext Gen Mobility \u003C/strong\u003E - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, \u0027Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMake Every Shot Count \u003C/strong\u003E - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and \u0027Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a \u0027Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a \u0027Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can\u0027t handle the stress.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFight Smart \u003C/strong\u003E - \u0027Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a \u0027quick kill\u0027. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable \u0027Mechs and components.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETeamwork is the Difference \u003C/strong\u003E - Targeting a \u0027Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInformation Warfare\u003C/strong\u003E - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault \u2018Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFind the perfect \u0027Mech \u003C/strong\u003E- Hundreds of unique \u0027Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller \u0027Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger \u0027Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different \u0027Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChoose Your Allegiance \u003C/strong\u003E - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGet Rewarded \u003C/strong\u003E - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new \u0027Mechs and equipment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECertain items can only be purchased using premium \u0027Mech Credits (MC).

In the years since Orcs Must Die! 2, Maximillian and Gabriella have done their best to rebuild the once-mighty Order. Their new enemy, the Unchained, is no longer the mindless horde defeated twice before, but instead an organized army led by its own powerful heroes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EKillin\u2019 Orcs and Smashin\u2019 Dorks\u003Cbr\u003EOrcs Must Die!\u2019s classic white-knuckle witch\u2019s brew of action and strategy returns, letting players team up with their friends to lay waste to millions of new invading monsters!

The \u0027one vs. thousands\u0027 exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EKey Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as \u0026quot;attacking head on,\u0026quot; \u0026quot;launching a surprise attack from an elevated position\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;infiltrating at night\u0026quot;, for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate.

In order to win you must wipe out the enemy population and simultaneously disable the enemy\u0027s ability to retaliate against you.

An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map.

    "desc": "It\u2019s been a generation since you vanquished the evil that plagued the Land of Ehb, and now\u2026a new menace has awakened. In Dungeon Siege II, the sequel to the best-selling RPG from Gas Powered Games, you will be called on to again wield sword and spell to save the world from a growing abomination many years in the making.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t A thousand years ago, the crusaders of Azunai crossed swords with the legions of Zaramoth in the final battle of a century-long rebellion. As the tyrannical god Zaramoth struck the final blow through Azunai\u2019s trembling shield, the earth shook. In that moment, the forces of magic were unchained, and both armies were consumed in a brilliant cataclysm that stretched for leagues across the Plain of Tears. Only a scarred wasteland remained as final testament to the First Age of Man.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t And for a millennium, magic has continued to spread to the farthest corners of the world, freely flowing to any who would command it. But the tide of magic has begun to wane, heeding instead the call of an ancient legacy. From the Plain of Tears a new heir beckons, and with each day his strength grows. Consuming those who submit, eradicating those who resist. With none to oppose his ascendance, the circle will be complete, and an ancient age will begin anew.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t What fate will befall the Second Age of Man? The time for judgment is nigh.",
